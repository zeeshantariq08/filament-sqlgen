# filament-sqlgen

A FilamentPHP package that integrates a Gemini-powered AI assistant to your Laravel admin panel â€” converting natural
language into SQL and showing results in real-time.

## Features

- **Text-to-SQL AI**: Converts natural language questions into SQL using Google Gemini and executes them securely.
- **Read-only access**: Executes only `SELECT` queries for safety.
- **Interactive UI**: Results are rendered in a styled HTML table within the Filament widget.
- **Easy setup**: Plug-and-play widget for any FilamentPHP admin panel.

## Requirements

- Laravel 8 or above
- FilamentPHP 3.x or above
- A Gemini API key from Google AI

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require zeeshantariq/filament-sqlgen
```

## Configuration

### 1. Publish the views (optional)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ZeeshanTariq\FilamentSqlGen\FilamentSqlGenServiceProvider"
```

### 2. Add your Gemini API key

In your `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

## Usage

Add the widget to your Filament dashboard or resource page:

```php
use ZeeshanTariq\FilamentSqlGen\Filament\Widgets\SqlGenWidget;

public static function getWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        SqlGenWidget::class,
    ];
}
```

Users can then type questions like:

> "How many users signed up today?"

The AI will respond by generating and executing a query like:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE();
```

The results are shown in a neat, scrollable table.

## Security

Only `SELECT` queries are allowed to prevent unwanted changes to your database. Write/update/delete operations are
blocked by design.

## Customization

To override the widget view:

1. Publish the views as shown above.
2. Modify the Blade view at:  
   `resources/views/vendor/filament-sqlgen/widgets/sql-gen-widget.blade.php`

You can style it using Tailwind or customize the logic as needed.
